Quintype is a structured CMS system. A story is comprised of cards, and cards of story elements.

### Story Types

Story type are predefined templates which can be used to write articles of various domains ranging from photo blogs, listicles, video stories, blogs etc. Story types give a definite structure and a "starting point" to authors when they starts writing a story. Apart from this, they also help in predictive analytics. Data can be derived and studied based on audience engagement on various story types for different domains (eg: A photo story on wildlife may get higher engagement than a text story). This also provides a definitive, analytics-backed suggestion to authors when they make a decision on the story type to pick for a certain idea.

### Something about Cards

Cardification is a new paradigm targetted towards mobile-first consumption of news. In this age of information bormbardment, we need to short and concise chunks of information, targetted towards mobile consumption. A simple comparison would be a "keynote presentation" to convey a point as opposed to a long form essay. Cardification is also a simple way of improving user engagement via sharing, commenting etc.. where a consumer can only focus on parts of the article that interest them.

### Something about Story Elements

Story elements are the smallest logical unit in the Quintype platform. They can be anything ranging from text, images, videos, audio, twitter/instagram posts etc. Story elements come together to form a card. A card can contain any number of story elements. Quintype also tracks these story elements and derives analytics reports based on user engagement on stories containing specific elements. For eg: A story on tennis containing more photo story elements might get higher engagement.
