# Story Collections

A story collection is a grouping of stories. The grouping of stories can either be done manually, or programatically, using predefined rules (which can take in personalization attributes). A story collection also contains metadata such as a hero image, and a title, making this suitable for Magazine Issues. A closely related concept is the [Stack](./stacks.md)

### Story Collection Types

A story collection can have one of the following types

* *content* - Corresponding to story collections created via the editor interface, and can have metadata.
* *search* - Corresponding to story collections that return different stories per user. Currently, these must be created by the Quintype team.
